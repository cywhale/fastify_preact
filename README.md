# MFPN

1. MongoDB - Fastify - Preact - Nodejs trial.

1. simplified to test my openocean app, and combined from all_it_learning/node_fastify and js/preact_client

2. can easily replace client codebase by ui/build 

## fastify server

nodemon server/server.js

## preactjs client

#### CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
