A nodejs server with fastify framework and preactjs in client.

#### simplified to test my openocean app, and combined from all_it_learning/node_fastify and js/preact_client

# fastify server
nodemon server/server.js

# preactjs client

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
